        <div class="coach-body">
          <p>
            As the coach behind CSCoaching, I’ve spent the past seven-plus years helping bowlers develop
            their skills, confidence, and understanding of the sport. I’m an ETBF Level 3 certified coach —
            the first woman in the UK to achieve that level — and I work with athletes ranging from
            absolute beginners to international competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            A key part of my coaching identity is being ADHD and proudly neurodivergent, which gives me a strong
            personal understanding of how differently people learn, process information, and communicate.
            Because of that, I make sure my coaching environment is genuinely neurodivergent-friendly:
            flexible, patient, clear, and adaptable. Whether someone needs step-by-step demonstrations,
            alternative explanations, or a bit more space to process, I shape my approach around what works for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            My coaching style is grounded in solid fundamentals, straightforward communication, and a relaxed,
            friendly atmosphere. I’m known for being approachable, supportive, and able to explain complex ideas
            in a way that actually makes sense — with the occasional joke, because learning should feel good,
            not stressful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently coach across multiple bowling centres and work with more than 15 students each week,
            tailoring sessions to individual goals and learning styles. I’ve also been part of Team England
            coaching, supporting athletes at the European Youth Championships and national training events.
            Watching the bowlers I work with achieve medals, rankings, and international opportunities is one of
            the best parts of what I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coaching sessions, I’m involved in strengthening the wider bowling community as Chair of both
            the Ron Daly Trios League and Yorkshire Juniors, working to create supportive spaces for bowlers of all ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            My aim is simple: help every bowler understand their game, enjoy the process, and move forward with
            confidence — in a way that genuinely suits them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want coaching that’s structured, friendly, and adaptable to who you are, you’ll fit right in here.
