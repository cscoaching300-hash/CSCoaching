          I’ve been asked to do a review for CSCoaching where to start well I only started coaching with Clare during the summer when I rocked up to her summer coaching sessions at Shipley she was welcoming, friendly and we have good banter but she defo knows how to tell you off too 😂 I started to bowl and Clare was very honest with me about my two handed bowling at this point I was falling out of love with the sport that I love so we transitioned to one handed little did I know that a couple of months later I would be taking home 1st in the under 22s at Washington I do what I do to make myself and my coach proud 😏🎳🏆

          I have been with Clare at CSCoaching for nearly 3 years and I have loved working with her to improve my game, actually, rebuild my game. For someone who bowled for fun for so many years, never having had any professional coaching, it was a big step, going back to basics and building on this. I am a senior bowler and bad habits are hard to shake when you have been doing them for so long, but with Clare’s knowledge, she has found ways to help me and if something didn’t work, change it and try again, but I trust Clare and this is important to my continuing improvement. She has given me the confidence to push myself and I am still learning.

          I’ve been with CSCoaching since the very beginning, for the last 7 years since Clare started coaching me back in 2018. Straight away you were able to tell Clare knew what she was on about. This amazing coach took me under her wing at the age of 11, and worked with me through the hard times and many breakdowns during bowling to get me to be the best I can be; and through her constant support I managed to claim 3 County Titles and win 3 European medals, and now I’m sat in the States while writing this, continuing with my dream of becoming a professional bowler.

          Clare is very patient and will work with you to find something that will work for you. She’s a Level 3 European Coach and one of the best in England — in my opinion one of the best in Europe. Clare will explain why you are doing what you are doing and will explain why things are happening, making sure you understand and can see all these things happening for yourself. This is something I’m so happy I have been taught, so I can see these things happening when Clare is not there. Being able to notice all these little things helps make a bowler a better bowler.

          Clare’s a very firm but fair coach. If you’re having a bit of an off day/week, she will make coaching more fun but still teach you the things you need to do, for example doing scotch doubles with you so you can practise your spares. She will do anything she can so that you enjoy your coaching that little bit more, and will always try her hardest to find ways for you to improve and enjoy the sport of bowling.
